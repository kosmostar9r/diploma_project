### My diploma project

  * This is my diploma project
  * The main goal was to create an algorithm to collect resources from asteroids
  * There are enemies who can also collect it and fight back
  * These enemies are made for practice and show matches
  * The condition for defending the diploma was a battle with a fellow students using an elo system: students has rating and each match can both increase or decrease rating
  * Student starts with 700pts and have to keep it for 2 weeks or reach 1000pts
  * My result was 830 in 2 weeks


#### To try it run:
  * $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  * $ python game.py
